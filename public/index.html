Julie Jen&eacute;, horse trainer, equine arts instructor, and certified
TT.E.A.M. practitioner, combined her 20 years of participation in the
horse world, her search for more effective training methods and her desire
to pass this information on to others when she encountered TT.E.A.M.
nearly fifteen years ago.
<p>

Julie had been searching for an approach which went beyond "kind and
gentle" horse training and found it in the TT.E.A.M. method.  She
discovered ways to prevent and solve problems in training through
<b>relieving discomfort</b> in the body of the horse as well as enhancing
<b>physical and mental ability</b> through working with the horse's unique
type of intelligence.  She found that using TT.E.A.M. to open new forms of
communication between humans and other animals is exciting and gratifying.
<p>

Trained by Linda Tellington-Jones and her sister Robyn Hood, Julie
practices and teaches these techniques at her training facility near
Spokane and in workshops around the United States and Canada.  Most people
are able to learn and utilize TT.E.A.M techniques in a very short time,
helping to alleviate pain, fear and tension and restoring calm and
confidence.  TT.E.A.M. techniques work <b>without pain, fear or force</b>
creating a <b>partnership</b> between humans and the animals we care for.

TT.E.A.M. (or Tellington-Jones Equine Awareness Method) was developed by
internationally know teacher, trainer and author Linda Tellington-Jones.  
She created this revolutionary technique for animals inspired by her four
years' of professional training with Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais and his work on
the method of functional integration and body work.  It is an alternative
approach to training and healing horses that relieves pain or tension in
the horse's body, often the cause of resistances and behavior problems,
through non-threatening manipulations known as TTouch.  TTouch combines
with unique TT.E.A.M. Ground and Awareness Exercises and Riding with
Awareness Techniques, frequently resulting in permanent changes in
personality, behavior and improved performance.  Even problems that are
commonly considered in the horse world to be unchangeable can often be
solved using the three phases of TT.E.A.M. <p>
<p>

The TT.E.A.M. techniques are rapidly becoming known as an effective and
gentle approach to solving behavior problems in companion animals, zoo
animals and other exotic species and have come to be called the
"Tellington-Jones Every Animal Method"!

him happily live for another year - relieved of his symptoms.  He could
even go for walks again!  Julie taught us how to use TT.E.A.M. to help him
ourselves, too."</i>

<center><h3>TT.E.A.M. Work</h3></center>
<p>

Through ongoing development of these techniques, it has become apparent
that this work with horses (and other animals) can not only overcome
resistance by can also <b>reduce stress</b>, <b>relieve back pain</b>,
<b>lameness</b>, <b>unevenness of gait</b>, <b>balance problems</b>,
<b>reduce inner tension</b>, <b>speed healing</b>, <b>reduce resistance to
vet and farrier</b>, and problems with: <b>saddling and grooming</b>,
<b>bucking and rearing</b>, <b>cinchiness</b>, <b>acceptance of
clipping</b>, <b>shots</b>, <b>mane pulling</b>, <b>pulling back when
tied</b>, <b>biting and kicking</b>, <b>shying</b>, <b>trailering</b> and
other difficult situations.  Horses trained in this method demonstrate a
markedly improved <b>willingness and ability to learn</b>.

The TT.E.A.M. ground exercises offer horses and opportunity to experience
new ways of moving and overcoming old behavior patters.  Experiencing
these exercises, without pain, fear or force, results in <b>obedience</b>,
<b>self control</b>, <b>self-confidence</b>, <b>balance and
coordination</b>.

<b>Riding with awareness</b> uses principles of Feldenkrais work, Centered
Riding and classical dressage to make <b>riding with joy</b> a reality for
people from all parts of the horse world!
